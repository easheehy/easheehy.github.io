		<h2>Biography</h2>
		<img src="profile.jpg" alt="This Web Developer in all his glory" height="300" width="300" hspace="20"></img>
		<p>I was born and raised in Irvine, California. Most of my childhood was spent playing video
		games, either by myself or with my dad or siblings. My interests ranged from Age of Empires II 
		and Lords of the Realm II to Prince of Persia and the first Call of Duty. With a father in Systems Programming 
		my childhood was shaped by video games and technology. Whether we were building a PC together or just gaming 
		my father and siblings were instrumental in my introduction to technology.</p>
		<p>During high school I took an IBM contest called "Master the Mainframe" which was one of ym first experiences with 
		proper programming and seeing how computers worked. It was facsinating and it quickly became one of my life goals to 
		work on mainframes like my father since I had enjoyed the experience so much.
